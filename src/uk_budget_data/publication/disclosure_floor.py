"""Thin cells in an artifact's household tables.

The decile tables (``distributional_impact``, ``winners_losers``) and the
age table (``age_impact``) average each household's change over a group. A
group whose change comes from fewer than SURVEY_HOUSEHOLD_FLOOR survey
households rests on too few cases to publish, however many households the
group holds: its average is those households' change over a group size
anyone can estimate (UK Data Service, CD171 section 5.2.1; 10 is the
working floor, as for the binned scatter). Microcosm builds several records
from one survey household, so the floor counts the survey households behind
the changed records (``pipeline.scatter_survey_households``), as the binned
scatter and the results by area do.

The age table may leave rows out, so a year with a thin age cell keeps only
its "all" row, or no row at all when "all" is thin itself: one withheld row
could otherwise be given back by the others and "all". The decile tables
must hold every decile, so generation refuses a run with a thin decile cell
(``generate._apply_disclosure_floor``), or, with THIN_DECILES_ENV set to
"warn", writes it and says which cells are thin, for a person to decide
before it is published.
